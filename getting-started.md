# Getting Started with Hardware Firewall
{: #getting-started}

The Hardware Firewall provides customers with an essential layer of security that is provisioned on demand without service interruptions. It prevents unwanted traffic from hitting your servers, reducing your attack surface, and allowing your server resources to be dedicated for their intended use.

To add a firewall to a server:

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure customer portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the customer portal navigation, go to **Devices > Device List** and click on the server you want protected.  
3. In the **Device Details** page, in the **Configuration** tab, scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Addons** section and click on the **Order Hardware Firewall** link.
4. In the **Order Hardware Firewall** dialog, choose from the options presented (if applicable) and press **Continue** to complete the ordering process. The firewall speed will default to the speed of the public network interface of your server.
